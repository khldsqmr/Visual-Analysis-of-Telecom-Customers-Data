# Visual-Analysis-of-Telecom-Customers-Data

This project aims at visually exploring the Telecom Customers data.

This notebook deals with various graphs and plots to identify trends and insights in the data set, which not only serves the purpose of business reporting but also aid in further analysis using classfication and clustering algorithms.

It contains visualizations for the following:
- *Quantitative variables:* are the values which can be discrete (integers) or continuous (real numbers). They are ordered numerical values which demonstrate a count or a measurement.
- *Categorical variables:* are assigned to a specific category/group, which showcases the qualitative property mainly. These variables take on a fixed number of values. For eg: (Red / Yellow / Blue, OR Yes / No, etc.)
- *Binary variables:* are the categorical variables when there are just two categories. For eg: (success / failure)
- *Ordinal variables:* are the categorical variables when the values are in orderly manner. For Eg: economic status (low income / middle income / high income).

It also contains visualizations to analyze multiple variables for the following cases:
- Quantitative VS Quantitative variables
- Quantitative VS Categorical variables
- Categorical VS Categorical variable
